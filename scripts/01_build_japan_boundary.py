"""Derive Japan's outline from the extract itself.

The rule is: the administrative relation at admin_level=2 carrying
ISO3166-1=JP. Nothing else is consulted. In particular Natural Earth is not:
its 10m coastline runs inland of the reclaimed land around Tokyo Bay and drops
about a quarter of the special wards' area, and the same class of error on a
country outline would silently remove the ports, which is where a great many
branded features are.

The boundary must also come from the same snapshot as the data. A boundary
drawn earlier once dropped a way created the day before the snapshot and broke
a ward's ring, and every area query for that ward was wrong afterwards.

Japan's outline in OpenStreetMap follows the coast and the maritime borders,
so what comes out here is a superset of the land and is used only to decide
what is in the country.
